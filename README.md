# KoaBlog

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tortillaj/Koa-Blog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tortillaj/Koa-Blog)

I am writing this blog engine to learn about Koa and RethinkDB. Since this is written with ES6, you'll want to make sure your machine can handle that. Also, I leave it to you to install RethinkDB and make sure it's running prior to testing or running this project.

This project uses:
- [Koa](http://koajs.com/)
- [RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com/)
- [Thinky](http://thinky.io)

To setup: `npm install`

To test: `npm test`
